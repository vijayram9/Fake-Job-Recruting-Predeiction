Project Overview

Employment scams are on the rise. According to CNBC, the number of employment scams doubled in 2018 as compared to 2017. The current market situation has led to high unemployment. Economic stress and the impact of the coronavirus have significantly reduced job availability and the loss of jobs for many individuals. A case like this presents an appropriate opportunity for scammers. Many people are falling prey to these scammers using the desperation that is caused by an unprecedented incident. Most scammer do this to get personal information from the person they are scamming. Personal information can contain address, bank account details, social security number etc. I am a university student, and I have received several such scam emails. The scammers provide users with a very lucrative job opportunity and later ask for money in return. Or they require investment from the job seeker with the promise of a job. This is a dangerous problem that can be addressed through Machine Learning techniques and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
